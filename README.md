## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your Android device (or an Android emulator)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JyotikaJayani-08/DriveLedger.git
   cd DriveLedger
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 📦 Building the Standalone APK

DriveLedger uses **Expo Application Services (EAS)** for building installable Android APKs without requiring Android Studio or local toolchains.

### 1. Configure EAS Build
EAS build profile is configured in `eas.json` to generate standalone APKs:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Build the APK in Cloud (Recommended)
Run the following command:
```bash
npx eas-cli build -p android --profile preview
```
- Log into your free [Expo account](https://expo.dev).
- Allow EAS to generate your Android Keystore.
- When the build finishes (~5–8 minutes), EAS will print a **direct download link** to your `.apk`.

## 🔄 Publishing Releases on GitHub

To distribute updates to your users:

1. In `app.json`, bump the version and version code:
   ```json
   "version": "1.1.0",
   "android": {
     "package": "com.driveledger.app",
     "versionCode": 2
   }
   ```
2. Build the new APK using `npx eas-cli build -p android --profile preview`.
3. Download the generated `.apk` file from the Expo dashboard.
4. Go to **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JyotikaJayani-08/DriveLedger/releases)** ➔ **Draft a new release**:
   - Tag version: `v1.1.0`
   - Release title: `DriveLedger v1.1.0`
   - Description: Add release notes (What's New)
   - Attach your downloaded `.apk` file under **Assets**.
5. Click **Publish release**.
6. When users tap **"Check for Updates"** in DriveLedger, the app will automatically fetch the new release and offer to download it!

## 🛡️ Sideload & Update Safety Rules

Because DriveLedger is distributed as an APK outside Google Play, keep these rules in mind:

| Rule | Details |
|---|---|
| **1. Never Uninstall Before Updating** | Installing a newer APK directly over the existing one replaces the app binaries while **Android preserves all SQLite data and vehicle logs**. Uninstalling first will delete your data! |
| **2. Export Backup Before Major Updates** | Go to **Settings ➔ Data & Storage ➔ Export JSON Backup** to save a snapshot to Google Drive or Files. |
| **3. Same Keystore Signature** | EAS securely manages your keystore in the cloud. As long as you build with EAS, every update shares the exact same signature. |
